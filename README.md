Udyoga Setu acts as a bridge between migrant workers and employers <br>
For now we created a python tkinter gui simulation of how this platform would work; 
firstly it asks for the type of login whether an employer or a worker
If worker, then opens the window asking for credentials such as name, skillset, pincode, city and state.
If employer, then asks for credentials of employer and the requiring skill set by him/her.
Then matches the required skill set by the employer with the workers and displays the workers with the matching skill set for the employer to choose.  

Its just a python tkinter 
As we are still working on our web version of the application, we are demonstrating using python
